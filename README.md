# Precalculus Practice Final Exam
Using [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com), this final exam extra credit project was created for my 11th grade Precalculus Fundamentals class. 
My exam includes multiple choice, short answer, word problem and graphing sections, evenly distributing material from the first eight units covered throughout the school year.
