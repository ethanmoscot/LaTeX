#### FinalExam
Using [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com), this 2017 final exam extra credit project was created for my 11th grade Precalculus Fundamentals class. 
I formatted my exam to include multiple choice, short answer, word problem and graphing sections. The questions on my final exam include an even distribution of material from the first eight units covered throughout the school year.
